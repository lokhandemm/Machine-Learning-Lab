# Machine Learning Lab: 
           
This repository contains Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms. The project includes practical implementations of key machine learning techniques and algorithms used to solve real-world problems.
  
## Algorithms Implemented:    

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for preparing datasets before training models, including handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features. 
- **Simple, Multiple, and Logistic Regression**: Implementations of linear regression for predicting continuous values, and logistic regression for binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Tree**: A supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks, with an emphasis on tree-building and decision-making processes.
- **KNN(k nearest neighbour) and Weighted KNN(weighted k nearest neighbour)**: Nearest neighbor-based algorithms for classification, where predictions are based on the majority class of the nearest data points.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm used for grouping data into clusters based on similarity.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between features.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression, focusing on finding the hyperplane that best separates classes in high-dimensional space.

## Technologies Used:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.(numerical python)
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
